## Traffic Stoppage Analysis
### Objective

The "Traffic Stoppage Analysis" project's goal is to examine the data gathered by the Stanford Open Policing Project, which compiles and standardizes traffic stop and search data from various U.S. police departments to scrutinize racial and ethnic disparities in policing and other police conduct and practices.

### Dataset Details
The data generally includes information about:
- Date and time of the stop
- Location
- Driver's race, gender, and age
- Reason for the stop (e.g., speeding, equipment violation)
- Result of the stop (e.g., warning, citation, arrest)
- Whether a search was conducted and if contraband was found

### Coverage:
The dataset covers 31 states, with data from dozens of individual departments. It's worth noting that the availability and granularity of the data can vary across states and departments, based on their respective data collection and reporting practices.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Analysis
- Visualization Techniques (EDA and Tableau)

### Conclusion
The project includes the interpretation of analysis results and insights gained from traffic stoppage data.
